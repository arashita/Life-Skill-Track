## **1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg**

**Question 1:**  
What was the most interesting story or idea for you in the video?  
**Answer:**  
The most interesting idea was BJ Fogg's concept of starting with tiny, almost laughably small habits, such as flossing just one tooth or doing just one push-up. It was inspiring to see how such small actions can snowball into significant behavioral changes when paired with a natural trigger and positive emotions. This approach removes the pressure of perfection and builds confidence.

**Question 2:**  
How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?  
**Answer:**  
B = MAP stands for **Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt**.

- **Motivation (M):** The desire to do the habit. High motivation makes it easier to start, but it fluctuates.
- **Ability (A):** How easy the habit is to perform. The simpler, the better.
- **Prompt (P):** A trigger or reminder to start the behavior. Without a prompt, the habit won't begin.

To make new habits easier:

1. Lower the difficulty (increase Ability).
2. Use a reliable prompt to remind yourself.
3. Keep motivation consistent by tying the habit to your values or goals.

**Question 3:**  
Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful habit completion?  
**Answer:**  
Celebrating reinforces the habit because it associates positive emotions with the behavior. When you "shine" or feel good about completing a habit, your brain is more likely to repeat it. Celebration also helps habits stick by creating an emotional connection, which is crucial for long-term success.

**Question 4:**  
What was the most interesting story or idea for you in the video?  
**Answer:**  
The most compelling idea was the concept of **compound interest in habits**. Just like small amounts of money can grow into a fortune over time, small improvements, even by 1% daily, can lead to exponential growth. Conversely, neglecting small habits can lead to a decline. The analogy with British Cycling's transformation through marginal gains was inspiring, showing how tiny, consistent changes can yield extraordinary results.

## **4. Atomic Habits Book Summary**

**Question 5:**  
What is the book's perspective about Identity?  
**Answer:**  
The book emphasizes that habits are most effective when they align with your identity. Instead of focusing on outcomes (e.g., "I want to lose weight"), focus on identity (e.g., "I am a healthy person"). By changing your self-image, your actions naturally align with your new identity, making habits sustainable.

**Question 6:**  
What does the book say about making a habit easier to do?  
**Answer:**  
To make a habit easier:

1. Reduce friction: Remove obstacles that make the habit hard to perform.
2. Use the **2-minute rule**: Start with a habit so small it only takes two minutes. For example, instead of "read for 30 minutes," start with "read one page."
3. Optimize your environment: Arrange your space to make the habit convenient and automatic.

**Question 7:**  
What does the book say about making a habit harder to do?  
**Answer:**  
To make a habit harder:

1. Increase friction: Add obstacles that make the habit inconvenient. For example, put your phone in another room to avoid using it.
2. Use technology: Block distracting apps or websites.
3. Reorganize your environment: Remove cues and triggers that prompt the habit.
